The upstream source package is modified as follows, and repacked as the
"dfsg" version:

remove doc/draft-ietf-avt-rtp-theora-00.txt
remove doc/draft-ietf-avt-rtp-theora-00.xml

These two files are draft RFCs that are not licensed under a DFSG license,
so cannot be included in Debian.

This package uses quilt for any modifications to the upstream source.
Please refer to /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for more information.
